# Neko Atsume Data

This assignment involved building a MySQL Database using the MySQL Workbench as well as run several MySQL queries against the database.

The data used for the assignment is from the popular Neko Atsume app curated by Reddit user capecodnative (https://www.reddit.com/r/nekoatsume/comments/blmtwo/neko_atsume_data_mining_spreadsheet_update_1130/). 
A Python script is used to scrub the Neko Atsume data in order to make it easier to load the data into the database.
